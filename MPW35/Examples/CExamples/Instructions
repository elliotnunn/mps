Instructions - The C ExamplesCopyright Apple Computer, Inc.  © 1987-1995All rights reserved.About the Examples	Eight sample C programs are included with ETO: an application,	a tool, a desk accessory, and a program that demonstrates the	use of performance tools:			Sample     - a simple MultiFinder-Aware Sample application		TESample   - a simple MultiFinder-Aware TextEdit application 		SillyBalls - a simple Color Quickdraw sample application							(Requires Color Quickdraw)		TubeTest   - a simple Color Quickdraw & Palette Manager 							Sample application							(Requires Color Quickdraw)		Count      - an MPW tool		Memory     - a sample desk accessory		EditCdev   - a sample Control Panel Device with a TextEdit item 		TestPerf   - a performance demonstration tool	The source files for each of these examples are in the	"Examples:CExamples:" folder.  A single makefile is provided	which contains the commands necessary to build each of the	targets.	Building the Examples	You can easily build each of the sample programs using the Directory	and Build menus.  (See "Building & Managing Programs In MPW".)		Set the default directory to "CExamples:"		The simplest way to do this is to select from the Directory menu		the menu item that ends in "CExamples:".  You can also set the		default directory by using the Directory and SetDirectory commands.			Build the program			To build a sample application, type "make <sample name>".		You may redirect the output of make to a temporary file,		using the redirection character ">"; or, you may allow make 		to write to the current window.				For example,				  make Count > Count.makeout		  		Will generate the build commands for the Count sample,		and redirect output to a file (which is created) named		Count.makeout.  You may then execute Count.makeout.	Sample - A Simple MultiFinder-Aware Sample Application	Sample is an example application that demonstrates how to initialize	the commonly used toolbox managers, operate successfully under 	MultiFinder, handle desk accessories and create, grow, and zoom windows.	The source for Sample (or TESample below) provides an excellent	framework for basing new applications. 	The source is contained in the files Sample.c and Sample.h, resource	descriptions are contained in the files Sample.h and Sample.r.	The make dependency file is named Sample.make.   To build Sample, simply select the lines below and press Enter.		make Sample > Sample.makeout		Sample.makeout		delete Sample.makeout   To execute Sample, select the line below and press Enter.		SampleTESample - A Simple MultiFinder-Aware TextEdit Application	TESample is an example application that demonstrates how to initialize	the commonly used toolbox managers, operate successfully under 	MultiFinder, handle desk accessories and create, grow, and zoom windows.	The fundamental TextEdit toolbox calls and TextEdit autoscroll are 	demonstrated. TESample also shows how to create and maintain scrollbar	controls.	The source for TESample (or Sample above) provides an excellent	framework for basing new applications.	The source is contained in the files TESample.c, TESampleGlue.a and	TESample.h, resource descriptions are contained in the files	TESample.h and TESample.r. The make dependency file is named	TESample.make.	   To build TESample, simply select the lines below and press Enter.		make TESample > TESample.makeout		TESample.makeout		delete TESample.makeout   To execute TESample, select the line below and press Enter.		TESampleSillyBalls - A Simple Color Quickdraw Sample Application	(Requires Color Quickdraw, e.g. MacII)	SillyBalls is a very simple sample program that demonstrates 	how to use Color QuickDraw.  It is about two pages of code, and 	does nothing more than open a color window and draw randomly 	colored ovals in the window.	The purpose is to show how to get some initial results with Color 	QuickDraw. It is a complete program and is very short to be as 	clear as possible.	The source is contained in the file SillyBalls.c.   To build SillyBalls, simply select the lines below and press Enter.		make SillyBalls > SillyBalls.makeout		SillyBalls.makeout		delete SillyBalls.makeout		   To execute SillyBalls, select the line below and press Enter.		SillyBallsTubeTest - A Simple Color Quickdraw & Palette Manager Sample Application	(Requires Color Quickdraw, e.g. MacII)	TubeTest is a simple demonstration of how to use 	the Palette Manager in a color program.  It has a special color 	palette that is associated with the main window.  The colors are	animated using the Palette Manager to give a flowing tube effect.	The program is very simple, and the Palette Manager and drawing 	parts are put in separate subroutines to make it easier to figure 	out what is happening.	The source is contained in the files TubeTest.c and TubeTest.r   To build TubeTest, simply select the lines below and press Enter.		make TubeTest > TubeTest.makeout		TubeTest.makeout		delete TubeTest.makeout		   To execute TubeTest, select the line below and press Enter.		TubeTestCount - A Sample MPW Tool	Count, a tool that runs in the MPW environment, counts characters and	lines in files.  A version of Count is included with MPW, and is	documented in the MPW Command Reference.  The source for Count is in	the files Count.c, FStubs.c, and Count.r.  MakeFile contains the	commands for building Count.   To build Count, simply select the lines below and press Enter.		make Count > Count.makeout		Count.makeout		delete Count.makeout		   To test Count, try counting the characters in file Count.c.		Count -c Count.c ∑∑ "{Worksheet}"Memory - A Sample Desk Accessory   Memory is a sample desk accessory written in C.  It displays the memory	available in the application and system heaps, and on the boot disk.	MakeFile contains the commands for building Memory.   To build Memory, simply select the line below and press Enter.		make Memory > Memory.makeout		Memory.makeout		delete Memory.makeout   To launch the Memory DA, switch to the Finder and double-click   on the Memory icon.EditCdev - A Sample Control Panel Device in C	EditCdev demonstrates how to implement a editText item	in a Control Panel Device.  It utilizes the new undo, cut, copy,	paste, and delete messages that are sent to cdevs in	response to user menu selections.   To build EditCdev, simply select the line below and press Enter.		make EditCdev > EditCdev.makeout		EditCdev.makeout		delete EditCdev.makeout			To execute EditCdev, after building it, simply select the Control	Panel from the Apple menu, and open the EditCdev icon in the list	of Control Panels.	TestPerf - An example of Using Performance Tools in C	TestPerf is an MPW tool that demonstrates the use of the performance	measurement tools.  MakeFile contains the commands for building TestPerf.	Several of the latest PowerPC machines will not have ROM maps supplied.	Do not build TestPerf on such a machine.   To build TestPerf, simply select the line below and press Enter.		make TestPerf > TestPerf.makeout		TestPerf.makeout		delete TestPerf.makeout			To execute TestPerf, select and execute the following command. (This	test will run about 15 to 60 seconds, depending upon the machine, with	only internal computations being performed):			TestPerf	TestPerf's raw performance data is written to the file Perform.out.	In this sample use of the performance measurement tools, the ROM was	measured.  So the ROM link map file needs to be combined with the program	link map file.  Because there are many different ROM maps, the build	process for TestPerf automatically appends the appropriate ROM map	for the current machine to the link  map file.  If you wish to do	this manually (for the cases where the program will be executed on	a machine other than the one used to build the program), you can	use a command similar to one of these:		# For Macintosh IIfx:		Catenate "{MPW}ROM Maps:MacIIfxROM.map" >> TestPerf.map			# For Macintosh Quadra 950:		Catenate "{MPW}ROM Maps:MacQuadra950ROM.map" >> TestPerf.map			# For Macintosh Quadra 840AV:		Catenate "{MPW}ROM Maps:MacQuadra840AVROM.map" >> TestPerf.map			And so on…	PerformReport is an MPW Tool that combines the output of the performance	tools with the link map file and produces a list of procedures, sorted by	estimated percent of time spent in each procedure.  To run PerformReport	execute the following command:		PerformReport -l TestPerf.map -m Perform.Out > Report.Out	The output of PerformReport is written to the file Report.Out.  To examine	this output, execute the following command:			Open Report.OutWriting Your Own Programs	After building (and perhaps modifying) the sample programs, you will	undoubtedly want to write a program of your own.  Use the New… item in	the File menu, to create the source files.  Remember that C language	source filenames should end in .c.		Create Build Commands…  -  The Create Build Commands… item in the 	Build menu runs a script that creates a makefile containing the	commands for building programs written in C, Assembly Language, Pascal, 	and/or Rez.  Selecting Create Build Commands… displays a dialog box that 	allows you to enter information about your program.  Type the program's	name, select its source files by clicking the Files… button, and click	one of the radio buttons to indicate your choice of an application, tool,	or desk accessory.  		Create Build Commands… puts the makefile for your program in the file	<program>.make.  Now you can use the Build menu to build and rebuild	your program, just as with the examples.		Larger Programs  -  If you add source files as your program grows,	use Create Build Commands… again to add the new source files to the build	instructions.  If you out-grow the capabilities of the simple Create	Build Commands… script (perhaps by using tools other than Asm, C, Pascal,	Rez, and Link in your builds) you can modify the makefile yourself.		Modifying the Directory and Build Menus  -  The Directory and Build	menus are both implemented using scripts written in the MPW Shell	command language.  This has the big advantage that you can modify	or customize them to match the way you work.
