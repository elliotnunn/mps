/*	file RenderingWindow.h		Description:	This file contains exported routine prototypes that can be used to call	the routines defined in RenderingWindow.c.  These routines used to	manage the windows displayed by the HTMLSample application.		HTMLSample is an application illustrating how to use the new	HTMLRenderingLib services found in Mac OS 9. HTMLRenderingLib	is Apple's light-weight HTML rendering engine capable of	displaying HTML files.	by John Montbriand, 1999.	Copyright: © 1999 by Apple Computer, Inc.	all rights reserved.		Disclaimer:	You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without	restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the	responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  However, what you are	not permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "DSC Sample Code"	after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source,	we require that you make it clear in the source that the code was	descended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.		Change History (most recent first):	10/16/99 created by John Montbriand*/#ifndef __RENDERINGWINDOW__#define __RENDERINGWINDOW__#include <Types.h>#include <Windows.h>/* InitRenderingWindows is called to initialize the environment used by 	routines defined in this file.
