/*	file AboutBox.c		Description:	This file contains the routines used to manage the about box window	displayed when the user chooses 'About HTMLSample...' from the file menu.		HTMLSample is an application illustrating how to use the new	HTMLRenderingLib services found in Mac OS 9. HTMLRenderingLib	is Apple's light-weight HTML rendering engine capable of	displaying HTML files.	by John Montbriand, 1999.	Copyright: © 1999 by Apple Computer, Inc.	all rights reserved.		Disclaimer:	You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without	restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the	responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.
