BasicDataBrowser Sample*******************************************************A high level outline of how to set up a Data Browser:- create the control- configure the formatting options & install callbacks- populate with initial items- route events like any other control & handle callbacks appropriatly******************************************************Detailed sequence of API calls:// Create a browserCreateDataBrowserControl(...);// Configure the browser (exact ordering doesn't matter)SetDataBrowserXXXX(...); // set various DataBrowser attributesSetControlFontStyle(...); // set the content font (defaults to the system views font)SetControlData(..., kControlKeyFilterTag,...); // Install a key filter// Setup and install your callbacksDataBrowserCallbacks callbacks;InitDataBrowserCallbacks(&callbacks); // Initialize an empty set of callbacks// Fill the various values of the callbacks structure with your UPPsSetDataBrowserCallbacks(browser, &callbacks); // If you're using the ListView view style, format the listAddDataBrowserListViewColumn(...); // repeat for each columnSetDataBrowserListViewXXXX(...); // customize ListView optionsSetDataBrowserTableViewXXX(...); // customize table options (these also work for ColumnView)// Now you can either explicitly populateAddDataBrowserItems(...);// Or you can implicitly populate by setting the target...// ...which will result in a series of ItemEventNotification callbacks during // which you can explictly populate, or start a thread to populate, etc.SetDataBrowserTarget(...);// route draw, track, hittest, keydown, etc events to // the DataBrowser as you would any other controlAll subsequent API usage is either an explicit change to the DataBrowser's state (changing a formatting attribute, changing view style, explicitly opening/closing/sorting a container, etc), or an implicit change initiated by a user interaction in which the appropriate callback(s) is/are called as needed.The most important of the callbacks...the one you can't live without...is the GetSetItemData callback. This is how you communicate your data model to the browser. It basically consists of a giant switch statement upon the property requested. For each case of the switch, use the appropriate SetDataBrowserItemDataXXX(...) routine to add your appropriate data to the DataBrowserItemDataRef. This data is used by the DataBrowser for all rendering, hit testing, tracking, editing, and dragging of the content, as well as determining which items are selectable, editable, containers, etc. Those properties for which you do not respond (have a case entry in your switch table), an appropriate default value will be used instead.The second most important callback is the ItemEventNotification callback. This is how the DataBrowser communicates changes of its internal state to your data model, and provides you with an opportunity to respond to each event or change in state...either by further manipulating the DataBrowser or some other part of your UI (opening a window in response to a DoubleClick event), or by updating your data model (fetching the contents of a container and further populating the DataBrowser in response to a ContainerOpened state change).
