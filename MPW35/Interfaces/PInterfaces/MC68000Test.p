This program assumes an MC68020, MC68030, or MC68040 processor.  It cannot be	 run on your MC68000 machine.”There is a possible error condition where the processor cannot be determined using theSysEnvirons() system trap (on systems older than 4.1).  In that case the following messageis generated:	“Sorry! I cannot determine what processor you are running on!  Since this program assumes	 you are running on an MC68020, MC68030, or MC68040, I am going to assume you have an	 MC68000 so it cannot be run on your machine.”Roughly, the cose of using abortToolOnMC68000() is about 750 bytes and abortOnMC68000()is about 1000 bytes.  By contrast, onMC68000, which doesn't really do much of anythingcosts about 100 bytes.Note: these routines live in their own private segment, MC68000Test.  The caller mightwant to do an UnloadSeg() on return since these routines would normally only be calledonce or you may want to resegment these routines to be part of your initialization code.They were segmented seperately to allow easy unloading or resegmenting.*)FUNCTION onMC68000: Boolean; C;	(*	This routine returns true if we are currently running on an MC68000 and false otherwise.	It is provided for convenience for those callers who wish to take some more appropriate	actions based on the processor (other than just aborting with a canned error message).	*)PROCEDURE abortToolOnMC68000(exitCode: Integer); C;	(*	This routine aborts a MPW Shell tool if it's running on an MC68000 processor.  It is	assumed that we are being called by an MPW Shell tool.  It writes a message to stderr and	aborts the tool if we are on a MC68000.  The tool exit status code is specified by the	caller (in exitCode).  If 0 is specified, 1 will be used.		If we are NOT on a MC68000, the routine simply returns to allow running of the tool.	*)PROCEDURE abortOnMC68000; C;	(*	This routine aborts the calling program if it's running on an MC68000 processor.  The	caller can be either an MPW Shell tool OR a standard Mac application.  It displays a	message in an alert dialog and aborts if we are on a MC68000.  	*){$ENDC}    { UsingMC68000Test }{$IFC NOT UsingIncludes}	END.{$ENDC}
