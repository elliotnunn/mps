#	File:	Directory2##	Copyright Apple Computer, Inc. 1991#	All rights reserved.###		Scripts that have Projector commands within them can normally not be #	executed by ToolServer. Using SourceServer, the RProj tool, and three support#	scripts (AliasSourceServer, UnaliasSourceServer, and Directory2), ToolServer#	can perform Projector functions. SourceServer must be running on the same#	computer as ToolServer before the Projector scripts can be executed.#	Individual Projector command lines are sent from ToolServer to SourceServer#	via AppleEvents by the RProj tool. To allow RProj to automatically be invoked#	any time a Projector command is encountered, we use the AliasSourceServer#	script to alias each ProjectorCommand to "RProj ProjectorCommand". To make#	sure that the aliases remain in effect even after the AliasSourceServer script#	has finished running, we must use the command line, "Execute AliasSourceServer".#	Directory commands also need to be aliased to Directory2, which will keep the#	current directory of both ToolServer and SourceServer set to the same location#	so both Projector and non-Projector commands operate on the same set of files.#	This alias is also established by the AliasSourceServer script. Finally, after#	completion of the Projector commands, "Execute UnaliasSourceServer" restores#	ToolServer to it's normal operation.##		This file, Directory2, is one of the support scripts.#		Prior to calling Directory2, the AliasSourceServer script has executed#	"Alias Directory Directory2". Within this script, we will use the built-in#	command, Directory, so we must unalias it to restore normal operation. The#	Unalias command has local scope, so upon exiting this script, the alias to#	Directory2 will be back in force!Unalias Directory#		The parameters for the original call to Directory remain the parameters#	for Directory2 also. We must now parse them and make sure the desired action#	takes place both for ToolServer and SourceServer:if {#} == 0#		"Directory", with no parameters, means to echo the current directory that#	the ToolServer script is executing in. For this we could just unalias directory#	and then make the call directly to the built in command. However, this is an#	opportunity to also insure that SourceServer is in synch with ToolServer. So #	a variable is set to the current directory and then sent off as a command to#	SourceServer. Finally, the vanilla directory command is finished by echoing#	the current directory.	Set myDir "`Directory`"	echo "{myDir}"	RProj Directory {myDir} ³³Dev:Nullelse	if "{1}" =~ /-q/#		Sending "Directory -q" is a special beast. I can't send the unquoted#	directory name on to SourceServer because the RProj command will treat each#	word of the file name as a seperate argument. Just send the unquoted shell#	directory back to ToolServer.		Directory "{1}"	else#		The main operation of Directory2 is to SET the directory! Do this#	for both the Shell and SourceServer.		Directory "{1}"		RProj Directory "{1}" ³³Dev:Null	endend
