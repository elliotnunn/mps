CFM_MachO_CFM Notes:
---------------------

This sample requires the enclosed Mach-O bundle "Test.bundle" be located at "/"

This sample demonstrates how to call a Mach-O function which takes a callback
function pointer as a parameter.  The main CFM application readies the callback
function by calling a routine MachOFunctionPointerForCFMFunctionPointer() which
generates power pc assembly glue to call the passed in function pointer.   This
generated glue is then passed to the Mach-O routine as the callback parameter.
