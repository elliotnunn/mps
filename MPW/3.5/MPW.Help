Projector
    Projector is a collection of built-in MPW commands and windows that
    help programmers (both individuals and teams) control and account for
    changes to all the files (documentation, source, applications etc.)
    associated with a software project.
    
    Here is a brief summary of the commands (the CheckIn, CheckOut, and
    NewProject commands also have windows that can be opened using the
    “-w” option to the respective command).  For help, enter a command such as

Launch

The command line used by MPW to launch an application consists of the name or path
of the application and, optionally, a list of files and command line options.

A command line consisting of an application name will cause the application to be
launched in the foreground.  If the application is already running, it will be
brought to the foreground.

Any files listed on the command line will be opened by the application if it is 
capable of opening them.  If the command line option -print is specified, the files
will be printed instead of opened and the application will quit when it has finished
printing the documents (unless it was already running).  (In previous versions of
MPW, this option was -p.)

The following options are recognized:

    -print                  # print any files listed on the command line.
    -background             # launch the application in the background
    -quit                   # cause a running application to quit
    -wait                   # delay resumption of Shell commands until the
                            # application has quit

    A "fragSpec" identifies a particular fragment within a file. Its syntax is -
    fragSpec  ::=  fragName[(fragInfo[,fragInfo]…)]
 
    A "fragName" is the name of a fragment and is case-sensitive. Its syntax is -
    fragName  ::=  characters other than '(', ')', '=' and ','
    fragName  ::=  '*'                    # matches any fragment name

    A "fragInfo" provides additional information which is used to identify a
    particular fragment within a file. Its syntax is -
    fragInfo  ::=  [arch=]pwpc       | [arch=]m68k           | arch=aNumber   |
                   [usage=]lib[rary] | [usage=]app[lication] | [usage=]dropin |

                            #   or '0x' is ignored)

    The comma-separated field specifications (following -f) take the forms:
    
            [F][.C][-K][bdlqrtux]
        or  [F][.C][+N][bdlqrtux]

    'F' is a field number (0=whole line [default], 1=first word, 2=second word…).
    'C' is the starting column number (from 1), default=1.
    'K' is the ending column number >= C, default=infinite.
    'N' is the maximum number of characters in the field, default=infinite.
    Only one of '-K' or '+N' can be specified.
    
    The local modifier characters 'bdlqrtux' have the same meaning on a
    per-field basis as -b, -d, -l, -q, -r, -t, -u and -x (which take effect
    globally).

    -s file                 # specify a file containing a script to execute
    -set variable[=string]  # set the value of a variable

    A script consists of zero or more of:
    
        <address> <command>
             or
        <address> -c count <command>
    
    The second form specifies that only the first "count" matches will be edited.

    Addresses take the forms (highest to lowest precedence):
    
        ( address )             # override precedence
        ! address               # match line not matching the address
        address1 && address2    # match line matching address1 AND address2
        address1 || address2    # match line matching address1 OR address2
        address1 , address2     # match address1…address2
        /regular expression/    # a line that matches the expression
        •                       # matches BEFORE the first line
        N                       # matches the Nth line
        $                       # matches the last line
        ∞                       # matches AFTER the last line

    A regular expression starting with 'ç' is case-sensitive.  Any '•' must
    follow the 'ç'.

    Commands are:
    
        Append <text>           # append text to append buffer
        Exit [status]           # exit with zero or specified status
        Change <text>           # set contents of edit buffer
        Delete                  # clear contents of edit buffer
        Insert <text>           # append text to insert buffer
        Next                    # proceed with next line
        Print <text>            # Print the text
             [-To file ]        #    directed to the specified file
             [-AppendTo file]   #    appended to the specified file
        Replace /pat/ <text>    # do replacement
                [-c count]      # specify repeat count (N or ∞)
        Set variable <text>     # set variable's value
            [-a]                #    append to variable's current value
            [-i]                #    insert at front of variable's current value
        Option AutoDelete       # append "1,$ Delete" to script
    
    Where <text> consists of zero or more of:
    
        "a string"              # the specified text
        'a string'              # the specified text
        .                       # the current line (the edit buffer)
        variableName            # the contents of the named string variable
        ®N                      # an "®" variable set by a regular expression
        -from <filename>        # the next line from the file, where filename
                                #    is a string or a variable name
        -n                      # suppress newline at end

    If <text> is empty, it defaults to "." (the current line).
