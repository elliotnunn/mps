This very simple sample demonstrates how to build a C++ application using Macintosh on RISC
tools.  If you have access to the MPW tool "CPlus" then you can also build a 68K version
of the sample and combine them into a 'FAT' application containing both 68K and Power
Macintosh versions.

To build the Power Macintosh version use:

make -f cplus_sample.make   

To build the 68K Macintosh version use:

make -f cplus_sample.make cplus_sample.68K

To build the 'FAT' version (combined 68K and Power Macintosh versions) use:

make -f cplus_sample.make cplus_sample.FAT

If you wish to build a debuggable version, add the option "-d SymOpt=on" to the
command line. 

make -e -f cplus_sample.make -d SymOpt=on  # (-e forces everything to be rebuilt).
