This example demonstrates how to create a shared library on the Power
Macintosh.  Since CFM is not present on the 68K Macintosh, no 68K version
is created.

To build the C Shared Library Example:

make -e -f ShLibExample.make

To build the C Shared Library Example suitable for debugging:

make -e -f ShLibExample.make -d SymOpt=on

The application (ShLibExample) will run successfully only if it's 
shared library (SharedLib) can be found.  The shared library will
be found if it is in the same folder as the application, or if it
is in the system extensions folder, or in an immediate sub-folder
of the system extensions folder.

If the shared library is not found when the application is launched,
the Power Macintosh will complain that it is missing a piece called
"SharedLib".
